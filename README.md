## Twitch Follow Bot
A selfbot that can do more than expected, originally created to gather up follow bot servers and use their follow bot.

## Getting Followers
Getting the followers are very simple. You just have to join the servers that give followers.
That's how you are able to get the channels to use them in.



### How do I use?
Firstly, you need to import the packages for the selfbot & system.

You have to install them from the shell in order to get the selfbot up and running
```pip
pip install discord
pip install colorama
pip install asyncio
```

### Now its finished!
Everything else will be inside of the code. Please note, I am not responsible for your ban if youg et one.
